# Mind Manifesting Counseling

Hello! My name is Travis Atchison of Mind Manifesting Counseling. I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) and I am also a Master Level Certified Addiction Professional (MCAP). 

You are your own expert. My role is to offer you guidance and support in exploring barriers and the difficulties of life. I will never tell you what to do. I view the therapist and client relationship as a collaboration. I operate on a strengths-based foundation which means I will work with you to identify your unique strengths rather than your deficits to improve your well-being. 

I work with children of all ages and adults. I utilize tools and techniques including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Solution Focused Therapy, trauma informed care, and person-centered approaches. I believe the therapeutic process is a holistic process. Therapy will assist you in challenging negative thoughts and beliefs that may undermine your quality of life. Sometimes we need to see beyond the frames of our everyday snapshot. 

I specialize in working with adults experiencing addiction and substance use related issues. 

I often tell clients finding a therapist is like shopping for new clothes. You rarely buy the first pair of pants you try on. I want you to feel comfortable in the therapeutic process. I am open to having a conversation prior to intake to see if I will be a good fit. 

I provide the unique service of offering therapy in your home. I only provide in-home therapy.
