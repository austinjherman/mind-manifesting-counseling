# About Us

## Dharti Atchison
![Dharti Atchison](/images/dharti-atchison.jpg "Dharti Atchison") Hello! I am Dharti Atchison! I was raised in Galveston, Texas and graduated with my bachelor's degree in Child Development and Education in 2013. I obtained my master's degree in Social Work in 2016 from Stephen F. Austin State University. I moved to Pinellas County in 2016 where I began working as a counselor supporting individuals with complex mental health concerns and homelessness. I have worked in various social work disciplines such as medical social work and mental health and substance use. Currently, I work as a director of transitional services for a local skilled nursing facility. I work to connect families and their loved ones to the highest quality of care.

## About Us
We have been married for almost six years and have experienced the greatest joys in life together as we have established our family which includes our three-year-old son Nikhil, our four-month-old daughter Niya, and our good boy Raja (our goofy and fun Golden Retriever)! We live in Largo, FL and love everything Pinellas! We enjoy family outings to the beautiful Indian Rocks Beach, our local Largo Central Park, and the wonderful local eateries Pinellas County has to offer. We pride ourselves on being involved in our community, spending time with our friends and family that live locally and serving our communities most essential needs related to the social work mission. Sometimes, we simply enjoy a day where we can shut down and watch fun movies with our kiddos, play in our homemade “redneck” pool, and sit back and relax.

  quote="Travis has redefined what therapy means for me. Over time his help has become something I really treasure, he has become a guide in my navigation of my psyche/brain. I think he sets an example of what a therapist should be. His friendly but professional approach is something that keeps impressing me time and time again. His knowledge knows no boundaries, and I would recommend him to anyone."

<Quote
  quote="I deliberately held off on posting a review until I'd had a few sessions, but at this point it's safe to say Travis knows exactly what he's doing! I came in thinking I knew everything about myself and where things went wrong, but he's led me to a bunch of new insights and strategies to manage my anxiety already. Easy to talk to and definitely a therapist I'd recommend."

<Quote
  quote="Travis is an amazing therapist. He was able to sort through my grief, exhaustion from attending 3 out of state funerals in 3 weeks, and frustration at dealing with fractured family dynamics at these services. He provided me with exercises and journaling suggestions to work through and process my feelings of anxiety and depression. Travis also gave me great ideas for how to improve my falling asleep routine, including a guided muscle relaxation technique. Everything Travis provided went straight to the heart of the matter and aided in getting me back on track to a safe and positive mental health. I would not hesitate to use Travis to work through issues which may arise in the future. Excellent service. Thank you!"

<Quote
  quote="I don't have much experience with therapy, but I've never found someone who is such a great communicator, being able to capture everything I say and didn't say perfectly. He's extremely intuitive, his years of experience as well as his passion for what he does (including how well he is at it!) is remarkable. Because of Travis, I would recommend therapy to everyone."
